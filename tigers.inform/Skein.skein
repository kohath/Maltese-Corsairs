The Maltese Corsairs
An Interactive Fiction
Release 1 / Serial number 100218 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) SD

Hold
On some occasions, the hold is an empty cavern full of not much beside the sound of waves.  Not this week, though.  Crates and crates--of cinnamon, of all things--line the bulkheads, leaving only a narrow path aft to the brig from the stair leading up to the crew quarters.

It&apos;s a small room, with a barred cell that takes up half of it.  The walls are a dingy white and the small lamp at the guard&apos;s desk doesn&apos;t do much to enliven the place.

A row of hammocks line the berth deck along the starboard side, which curves to create a moderately open space.  A curtained alcove off the opposite side secludes the cannon master&apos;s bed from casual view. You still haven&apos;t been able to figure out why the captain won&apos;t set up cabins for everyone.

Deck
The sea stretches out in every direction... but you&apos;re standing on the deck of the Joli, which feels cramped by comparison. (You never did get the hang of how much smaller life aboard ship is.) The entrance to the captain&apos;s hall is aft, and the deck extends in the opposite direction to the fo&apos;c&apos;sle.  You could also climb up to the crows&apos; nest, or go down to the Cannons.

Mess
A pair of long tables are the main feature of the mess. You can probably count on one hand the number of times the whole crew has sat down to eat together, though. Rock generally leaves a plate or pot of something out for folk, and today is no exception.

Galley
The ship&apos;s kitchen is not very large, and the presence of the cook generally leaves it much more cramped.  Cabinets line the upper and lower walls, and a small bench sits by the entrance, fore.

Crew Quarters
A row of hammocks line the berth deck along the starboard side, which curves to create a moderately open space.  A curtained alcove off the opposite side secludes the cannon master&apos;s bed from casual view.

If you need to hit the head, the door is on the fore wall; the mess is aft, and stairs lead down to the hold and up to the Cannons.

Brig
It&apos;s a small room, with a barred cell that takes up half of it.  The walls are a dingy white and the small lamp at the guard&apos;s desk doesn&apos;t do much to enliven the place.   We don&apos;t normally deal in prisoners, so most of the time brig duty is just a chance to sneak in an extra shift of sleep.

Crew Quarters
A row of hammocks line the berth deck along the starboard side, which curves to create a moderately open space.  A curtained alcove off the opposite side secludes the cannon master&apos;s bed from casual view. You still haven&apos;t been able to figure out why the captain won&apos;t set up cabins for everyone. 

If you need to hit the head, the door is on the fore wall; the mess is aft, and stairs lead down to the hold and up to the Cannons.

Crew Quarters
A row of hammocks line the berth deck along the starboard side, which curves to create a moderately open space.  A curtained alcove off the opposite side secludes the cannon master&apos;s bed from casual view. You still haven&apos;t been able to figure out why the captain won&apos;t set up cabins for everyone. 

If you need to hit the head, the door is on the fore wall; the mess is aft, and stairs lead down to the hold and up to the Cannons.

Fiordaliso is asleep in his hammock.

Mess
A pair of long tables are the main feature of the mess. You can probably count on one hand the number of times the whole crew has sat down to eat together, though. Rock generally leaves a plate or pot of something out for folk, and today is no exception.

Galley
The ship&apos;s kitchen is not very large, and the presence of the cook generally leaves it much more cramped.  Cabinets line the upper and lower walls, and a small bench sits by the entrance, fore.

The cook is a good three hundred fifty pounds, and it&apos;s easy to see why--he never does seem to stop eating.  He makes good food, all right, but he hasn&apos;t got the most pleasant personality; he&apos;ll throw you out of the mess for the slightest thing.

The gun deck is long with a low ceiling, lit only by dim shafts of sunlight falling on rows of cannons aimed outwards.

Deck
The sea stretches out in every direction... but you&apos;re standing on the deck of the Joli, which feels cramped by comparison. (You never did get the hang of how much smaller life aboard ship is.) The entrance to the captain&apos;s hall is aft, and the deck extends in the opposite direction to the fo&apos;c&apos;sle.  You could also climb up to the crows&apos; nest, or go down to the Cannons.

Captain&apos;s Hall
The captain generally keeps all his equipment here, more likely than not stacked at random on the grand table at the center of the room.  The walls are also bedecked with miscellany finds from the ship&apos;s travels, including a shelf with a radio that won&apos;t be useful for another hundred years or so.  The captain&apos;s quarters are to starboard and the first mate&apos;s to port.

Crows&apos; Nest
The view from the crow&apos;s nest is impressive--the blue-green sea in every direction, and the deck below mostly obscured by the rigging.   Unfortunately it&apos;s a tiny space in and of itself, which makes you despise every second duty keeps you up here.

Iñigo sits here, keeping watch.,

Brig
It&apos;s a small room, with a barred cell that takes up half of it.  The walls are a dingy white and the small lamp at the guard&apos;s desk doesn&apos;t do much to enliven the place.   We don&apos;t normally deal in prisoners, so most of the time brig duty is just a chance to sneak in an extra shift of sleep.

Suede sits at the guard&apos;s desk, playing solitaire.
